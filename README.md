# Game Manager
This tool will let you manage & improve the experience of the supported games. 

I noticed a lot of games have very limited FOV options, or NO option to change the FOV at all. That's where this tool comes in place.
Some games support other fun stuff, such as God Mode, Ghost Mode, Unlimited Ammo, AND an FPS Unlocker for Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater.

Decided to do this fun little project to better myself in memory hacking!



# Current Features:

* Game Hours Tracker (Playtime)
* FOV Changer for every supported game in the list
* Some games also have other features; Unlimited Ammo, God Mode, Ghost Mode, FPS Unlocker, etc.
* Pattern Scanner to prevent game updates/versions from breaking the mods.
* FOV Settings are saved to a config file and loaded whenever you select a game. So setting your desired FOV every time is not required!

# Notes

* For problems, requests (games/features) open an [Issue](https://github.com/xwzrdx/GameManager/issues)
* If you want to support what I do, feel free to [buy me a coffee!](https://buymeacoffee.com/wzard) so I can buy the legit games on their respective platforms to further expand this tool properly!
* The tool has been tested on Fit-Girl Repacks, different versions are hard to test since I don't own the official builds.
* See [here](https://github.com/xwzrdx/GameManager/issues/1) for immediate issues & fixes.
* This tool is fully external, meaning it does not inject into any game by any means!
* Most games are signature scanned, meaning updates/different versions SHOULD work. Although I don't own different versions for most games so I can't pratically test as well as I wish I could.
* For a full list of games see the tool's game list.
* For safety, don't use online & if applicable use -nobattleye or -nobe or -eac_launcher to disable the game's respective anti-cheats (BattlEye & Easy Anti Cheat)
